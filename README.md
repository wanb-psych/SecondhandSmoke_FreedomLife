**Abstract:** The present study aims to examine whether second-hand smoke exposure (SHSE) in university students can affect three indices of self-satisfaction related to depression as indiced by appearance, weight, and freedom of life choice. We collected data from740 non-smoking students in the summer of 2018, of which 57.84% were exposed to second-hand smoke. Depressive symptoms, SHSE, smoking status, weight satisfaction, appearance satisfaction, and freedom of life choice were self-reported via a questionnaire. Results: The generalized linear analyses revealed that SHSE was linked to lower scores of perceived freedom of life choice but not significantly associated with weight nor appearance satisfaction. The mediation analyses indicated that perceived freedom of life choice fully mediated the association between SHSE and depressive symptoms. These findings shed light on the importance of SHSE and its effects on mental health in university students. Preventive strategies should therefore locally target university campuses.
